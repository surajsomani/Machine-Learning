r^2 = 1 - SSE/SST

SSE = Sum of squared error is sum of squares of error for all predictions
SST = Sum of squared error with the mean of the prediction

So just saying mean as prediction gives SST 
we want to know how good our prediction is with respect to 
just saying mean as the output

if R^2 = 0.8 then we know that SSE/SST=0.2
